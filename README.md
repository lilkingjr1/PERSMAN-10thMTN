## PERSMAN
#### A personnel management tool built with NodeJS, Express and MongoDB.

This is a very much in development project. As such, a user guide is not available at this time. But, if you would like to look at an admittedly out of date version of the website, here you go https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxKYfj0BRo0. I will make a new version ASAP.

Recent features include a dark theme, and a customizable settings page with some basic settings, such as roles, certifications, available platoons and squads (which can be as many as you want). It currently only supports one company, but I am hoping to update and expand that too unlimited soon.

Feel free to modify and change the application in anyway you want.
