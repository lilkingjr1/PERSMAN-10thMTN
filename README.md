## PERSMAN for 10th Mountain Division
#### This is a custom fork of Lyon Jenkins' [PERSMAN](https://github.com/LyonJenkins/persman-archived), specially made for the 10th Mountain Division Arma Mil-Sim Unit

This version contains specialized formatting and graphics specifically for the 10th Mountain Division. It is meant, for all intents and purposes, to be private and for this unit only.

If you would like a more generic version of this site, suitible for use by any unit, please check out my fork of the original project at https://github.com/lilkingjr1/persman
