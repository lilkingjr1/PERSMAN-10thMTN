Dedicated to quality and teamwork, we hope prospective members will be interested in our direct-action activities across a variety of missions.</h5>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Biography</h2>\r\n<br>\r\n10th Mountain Division is a unit that was created by a member base that has been doing ArmA 3 mil-sim for upwards of 5 years. We've decided to establish ourselves as a unit in order to find other like minded people to become members of our active and tight-knit community. We're modeled off the United States Army 22nd Infantry Regiment and will be conducting operations that are comparable to our real-life counterpart. As a semi-fictional unit, we'll have the flexibility to participate in operations that are on going in the real-world, explore \"what-if\" scenarios, or create our own. \r\n<br><br>\r\nIf this sounds like something you're interested in and want to become a part of, submit an application and PLEASE JOIN either our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/zPmUpYU\" target=\"_blank\">Discord</a> or <a href=\"ts3server://ts.10thmtn.org\" target=\"_blank\">TeamSpeak</a> servers to find more information and to meet our members.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h2>Climb to Glory!</h2>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"/images/10th_logo_motto.png\">\r\n</center>","faq":"","resourceLinks":["https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m9pg61-rfC3yhndQZUIZAO7laRFHQlV82tQSg4j4OCw/edit?usp=sharing","https://docs.google.com/document/d/11DgFRLRKKL6cJNK99ru7hTNPqv4pafoo7uqs7gUDK1A/edit?usp=sharing"],"resourceTitles":["Student SOP Manual","Community Guidelines"],"mailerEmail":"","mailerPassword":"","websiteLogo":"/images/10th_logo.png","carouselImages":["/images/banner1.jpg","/images/banner2.jpg","/images/banner3.jpg","/images/banner4.jpg","/images/banner5.jpg","/images/banner6.jpg","/images/banner7.jpg","/images/banner8.jpg"],"carouselTitles":["Arma 3 Milsim Mountain Warfare Unit","With 50+ members and growing our comunity continues to stay active and diverse.","Never a dull moment - Operations every Sunday and exercises throughout the week.","Friendly staff are always able and willing to support all player skill levels.","Join exciting/action packed missions that mix story and tactics for an immersive experience.","Climb to glory as 10th MTN will conquer any challenging terrain or environment.","Grow camaraderie and effective combat strategies with our well-trained members.","We look forward to seeing you on the battlefield!
