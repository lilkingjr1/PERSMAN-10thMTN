Dedicated to quality and teamwork, we hope prospective members will be interested in our direct-action activities across a variety of missions.</h5>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Biography</h2>\r\n<br>\r\n10th Mountain Division is a unit that was created by a member base that has been doing ArmA 3 mil-sim for upwards of 5 years. We've decided to establish ourselves as a unit in order to find other like minded people to become members of our active and tight-knit community. We're modeled off the United States Army 22nd Infantry Regiment and will be conducting operations that are comparable to our real-life counterpart. As a semi-fictional unit, we'll have the flexibility to participate in operations that are on going in the real-world, explore \"what-if\" scenarios, or create our own. \r\n<br><br>\r\nIf this sounds like something you're interested in and want to become a part of, submit an application and PLEASE JOIN either our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/zPmUpYU\" target=\"_blank\">Discord</a> or <a href=\"ts3server://ts.10thmtn.org\" target=\"_blank\">TeamSpeak</a> servers to find more information and to meet our members.\r\n</center>","faq":"<center>\r\n<h4>This page is currently under development</h4>\r\n</center>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Question #1:<br>Answer #1</li>\r\n<li>Question #2:<br>Answer #2</li>\r\n</ul>","resourceLinks":["https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m9pg61-rfC3yhndQZUIZAO7laRFHQlV82tQSg4j4OCw/edit?usp=sharing","https://docs.google.com/document/d/11DgFRLRKKL6cJNK99ru7hTNPqv4pafoo7uqs7gUDK1A/edit?usp=sharing"],"resourceTitles":["Student SOP Manual","Community Guidelines"],"mailerEmail":"","mailerPassword":"","websiteLogo":"/images/10th_logo.png","carouselImages":["/images/banner3.jpg","/images/banner1.jpg","/images/banner2.jpg"],"carouselTitles":["Welcome to 10th Mountain Division","",""],"modlistURL":"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1975625031","a3unitsURL":"https://units.arma3.com/unit/10thmtn","steamgroupURL":"https://steamcommunity.com/groups/10thmtndivision","donateURL":"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=RK8Y7WRHQTRL4&source=url","ts3URL":"ts.10thmtn.org","discordURL":"https://discordapp.com/invite/8BBDHMz","youtubeURL":"","instagramURL":"https://www.instagram.com/10thmtnarma/","enableApplication":"on","enableCallToAction":"on","enableRetiredMembers":"on","companies":["Anvil"],"platoons":["Company HQ","2-10th Aviation Regiment","1st Platoon","2nd Platoon","Training Platoon","None"],"squads":["Headquarters","1st Squad","2nd Squad","3rd Squad","4th Squad","Training","None"],"teams":["Leadership","Alpha","Bravo","None"],"sShops":["S-1","S-2","S-3","S-4","S-5"],"ranks":["None","RCT","PVT","PV2","PFC","SPC","CPL","SGT","SSG","SFC","MSG","1SG","SGM","CSM","WO1","CW2","CW3","CW4","CW5","2LT","1LT","CPT"],"roles":["Rifleman","Team Leader","Squad Leader","Platoon Sergeant","Platoon Leader","Company Leader","Game Master","Radio Operator","Pilot","Medic","None"],"tabs":["Mountain","Ranger","Airborne"],"tabDesc":["Airborne description","Ranger description","Mountain desc."],"certifications":["Basic Combat Training","Airborne School","Pathfinder School","Air Assault School","Ranger School","Heavy AT Qualified","Advanced Explosives Qualified","Grenade Launcher Qualified","Combat Lifesaver","Basic Leader Course","Advanced Leader Course","RTO School","Designated Marksman"],"awards":["Basic Parachutist Badge (10)","Senior Parachutist Badge (30)","Master Parachutist Badge (65)"],"awardDesc":["Awarded for 10 successful parachute jumps.","Awarded for 30 successful parachute jumps.","Awarded for 65 successful parachute jumps."],"userGroups":["Guest","Enlisted","Instructor","Recruiter","Officer","Site Admin"],"enableVisibility":"on"}
